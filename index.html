About
￼
It's the same old story—I can't resist a classic black turtleneck.
My path to education began with a paper route at age ten, delivering the Boston Globe—a foundational experience that taught me about work ethic, community, and showing up consistently. That early lesson has shaped everything since.
For over a decade, I built technology companies, led diverse teams, and worked on workforce development initiatives in Oakland and San Francisco. As founder and CEO of BriteHub, I raised $2.5M and scaled a platform to over 10,000 users. I served on workforce development boards, spoke at national conferences, and collaborated with incredible people tackling complex community challenges.
But my most fulfilling work has always involved young people—from nannying to creating job training programs for transitional youth, from mentoring high school interns to helping underserved students access manufacturing careers. These experiences revealed my true calling: teaching.
Today, I'm completing my M.Ed. at Lesley University while teaching across K-12 classrooms in Massachusetts. As a future high school English teacher, I'm committed to bringing my experience navigating complex systems and building inclusive environments to support students facing systemic barriers.
I believe in the transformative power of public education and the critical role teachers play in creating opportunity. My journey from technology to teaching reflects my commitment to making meaningful change at the grassroots level—in classrooms where individual connections transform lives.
